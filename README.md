My book app
I am building the app with the instructions from the video, it was working perfectly until I got to the "addBook" function. The function was not able to render the books from this.state., ie, when I click the addBook button, I will not see the book added to the app UI. I have checked my code many times but was not able to debug the error.
I have been here since yesterday because every other function somehow depend on it.
I hope that you might have an idea of what is wrong with my code.
